# VRChat Photo Uploader

Upload your VRChat photos to Discord with ease!

## Description

VRChat Photo Uploader is a tool that allows users to easily upload their VRChat photos to a specified Discord webhook. If the photos contain metadata (like world and player information), it's extracted and used to create a rich message in Discord. For photos without metadata, the tool simply uploads them without an accompanying message. If a photo exceeds Discord's size limits, the tool automatically compresses it to ensure successful uploads.

This tool is now packaged as an executable with an easy-to-use installer, so no Python installation is required!

## Features

- **Easy to Use**: Simple GUI for selecting photos and specifying a Discord webhook.
- **Metadata Extraction**: Extracts world and player information from VRChat photos when available.
- **Clickable World ID URLs**: Automatically generates clickable links for world IDs, allowing users to open corresponding VRChat worlds in their browser.
- **Automatic Compression**: Compresses photos that exceed Discord's file size limit.
- **Webhook Management**: Save and manage multiple Discord webhooks for easy reuse.
- **Discord Media Channel Option**: Includes a "Discord Media Channel" checkbox for uploads to Discord Media Channels, ensuring compatibility with Discord's media channel features.
